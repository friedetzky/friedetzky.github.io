Firefighting with Algorithms

The Firefighter problem is to place firefighters on the vertices of a
graph to prevent a fire with known starting point from lighting up the
entire graph. In each time step, a firefighter may permanently protect
an unburned vertex. After that, every vertex that is adjacent to a
burning vertex starts to burn, assuming that it has no previously been
protected. The goal is to let as few vertices burn as possible. This
problem is notoriously hard: it is NP-complete even when restricted to
bipartite graphs or to trees of maximum degree three. We study this
problem from two different angles: 1) Initial study showed the
Firefighter problem to be fixed-parameter tractable on trees in various
parameterizations. We complete these results by solving various open
questions posed in the existing study.  We also give refined algorithms
on trees, improving on the running times of the known algorithms.  2) In
spite of the hardness results, we show that the problem is still
polynomial-time solvable on the well-known class of interval graphs. A
generalization into two dimensions, for instance to unit disk graphs, is
not tractable: we prove the problem to be NP-complete.
