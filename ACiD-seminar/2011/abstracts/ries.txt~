d-Transversals of Stable Sets and Vertex Covers in Weighted Bipartite Graphs

Abstract: Let G=(V,E) be a graph in which every vertex v in V has a
weight w(v)>=0 and a cost c(v)>=0. Let S_G be the family of all
maximum-weight stable sets in G. For any integer d>=0, a minimum
d-transversal in the graph G with respect to S_G is a subset of vertices
T of minimum total cost such that |T \cap S|>=d for every S in S_G. We
present a polynomial-time algorithm to determine minimum d-transversals
in bipartite graphs. Our algorithm is based on a characterization of
maximum-weight stable sets in bipartite graphs. We also derive results
on minimum d-transversals of minimum-weight vertex covers in weighted
bipartite graphs.
