Colouring AT-free graphs

Three vertices of a graph form an asteroidal triple (short AT) if
between any two of them there is a path avoiding all neighbours of the
third. This concept was introduced by Lekkerkerker and Boland in 1962
to characterise interval graphs as those chordal graphs having no AT.
Asteroidal triple-free graphs form a graph classes with a lot of
interesting structural and algorithmic properties; most of them
discovered in the late nineties initiated by the important work of
Corneil, Olariu and Stewart.

A vertex colouring assigns to each vertex of a graph a colour such
that adjacent vertices have different colours. The algorithmic
complexity of the COLOURING problem, asking for the smallest number of
colours needed to vertex colour a given graph, is known for a huge
number of graph classes. In fact, it is solvable in polynomial time
for perfect graphs, and thus for all their subclasses.

Broersma et al. asked to find out the algorithmic complexity of
COLOURING on AT-free graphs. Even the algorithmic complexity of the
k-COLOURING problem, which asks whether a graph can be coloured with a
fixed number k of colours, remained unknown for AT-free graphs until
recently; for k=3 Stacho presented a polynomial time algorithm. We
show that k-COLOURING is polynomial-time solvable on AT-free graphs.
