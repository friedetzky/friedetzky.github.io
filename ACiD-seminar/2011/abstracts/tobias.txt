Some results on geometric representations of graphs

A d-dot product representation of a graph G assigns a vector u_i in
R^d to each vertex i, in such a way that  u_i^T u_j >= 1 if and only
if {i,j} is an edge of G. The least dimension d for which such a
representation exists is called the dot-product dimension of G. By
making use of some classical results in algebraic geometry, oriented
matroids and the Colin de Verdiere graph parameter, I will sketch the
proofs of some results on dot product representations and other
geometric representations of graphs.
