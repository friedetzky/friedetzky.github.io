The number of Euler tours of a random d-in/d-out graph

We obtain the expectation and variance of the number of Euler tours of a
random d-in/d-out directed graph, for d>=2. We use this to obtain the
asymptotic distribution and prove a concentration result. We are then
able to show that a very simple approach for uniform sampling or
approximately counting Euler tours yields algorithms running in expected
polynomial time for almost every d-in/d-out graph.  We make use of the
BEST theorem of de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte,
which shows that the number of Euler tours of a d-in/d-out graph is the
product of the number of arborescences and the term ([(d-1)!]^n)/n.
Therefore most of our work lies in estimating the asymptotic
distribution of the number of arborescences of a random d-in/d-out
graph.
