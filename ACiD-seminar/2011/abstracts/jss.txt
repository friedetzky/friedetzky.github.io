Odd cycles in Planar Graphs

The talk will focus on questions about covering and packing of odd
cycles in planar graphs. Several results and conjectures will be
presented, in particular concerning the relations between the packing
and covering numbers. Time permitting, these parameters will also be
considered under a different objective function, coined "fair".

The talk shall be high-level rather than technical, centered on ideas
and tools used rather than specific and precise proofs.
