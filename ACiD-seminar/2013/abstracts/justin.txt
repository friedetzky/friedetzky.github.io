Maximising Bisubmodular and k-Submodular Functions

Submodular functions play a key role in combinatorial optimisation and in
the theory of valued constraint satisfaction problems. Recently, there has
been interest in various generalisations of submodularity, including
bisubmodular functions, which operate on disjoint pairs of sets, rather than
single sets.  Like submodular functions, bisubmodular functions can be
minimised exactly in polynomial time and exhibit the property of diminishing
returns.  In this talk, I will present recent joint work with Stanislav
Zivny on maximising both bisubmodular functions and also general
k-submodular functions, which operate on disjoint k-tuples of sets.
Additionally, I will discuss the relationship between bisubmodularity and
submodularity, and show how our results on bisubmodular functions can
provide intuition for existing algorithms that maximise submodular
functions, such as the recent 1/2-approximation algorithm of Buchbinder,
Feldman, Naor, and Schwarz.
