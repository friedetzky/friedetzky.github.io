Reordering Buffer Managment

In a classical online problem arriving requests have to processed
immediately and in order of arrival. In some applications on the other hand,
it is possible to temporarily store arriving sequences in a fixed sized
buffer before processing. Only when the buffer is full, the algorithm is
forced to decide which request from the buffer to process (and how).

We will discuss problems with this property and analyze them. In particular
we will talk about a model in which a colored items, which arrive one by
one, have to be grouped together according to their color to minimize cost.
