Complexity of Coloring Graphs without Paths and Cycles

Let P_t and C_l denote the path on t and l vertices, respectively. It is
known that k-coloring is NP-complete for P_t-free graphs, for most
combinations of values of k and t. In this talk, we study the complexity of
k-coloring (P_t,C_l)-free graphs. We prove that for most values of k,l,t,
the problem is still NP-complete. On the positive side, we develop a linear
time certifying algorithm for 3-coloring and 4-coloring (P_6,C_4)-free
graphs by providing a complete finite list of minimal non-k-colorable
(P_6,C_4)-free graphs for k=3,4. For higher value of k, it seems impossible
to provide such a list. Yet, we show that the number of minimal
non-k-colorable (P_6,C_4)-free graphs is always finite.

This is a joint work with Pavol Hell.
