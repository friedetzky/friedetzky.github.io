AT-free graphs: structure and algorithms

Three mutually different vertices of a graph
are said to be an asteroidal triple  if between
any two of them there is a path avoiding the neighborhood
of the third. Graphs without asteroidal triple are
called AT-free graphs. AT-free graphs contain
various well-known classes of perfect graphs, as e.g., interval,
permutation and trapezoid graphs.
A lot of research on AT-free graphs has been done in the last
20 years. We present some fundamental structural properties
of AT- free graphs and discuss the algorithmic complexity
of some NP-hard problems on AT-free graphs.
