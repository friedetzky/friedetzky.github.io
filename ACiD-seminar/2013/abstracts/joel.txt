Decision Problems for Linear Recurrence Sequences

Linear recurrence sequences (such as the Fibonacci numbers) permeate a vast
number of areas of mathematics and computer science and also have many
applications in other fields such as economics, theoretical biology, and
statistical physics. In this talk, I will focus on three fundamental
decision problems for linear recurrence sequences, namely the Skolem Problem
(does the sequence have a zero?), the Positivity Problem (are all terms of
the sequence positive?), and the Ultimate Positivity Problem (are all but
finitely many terms of the sequence positive?).

This is joint work with James Worrell.
