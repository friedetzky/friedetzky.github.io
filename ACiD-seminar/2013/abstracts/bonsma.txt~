TITLE: Independent Set Reconfiguration in Cographs

ABSTRACT:

We study the following independent set reconfiguration problem: given
two independent sets A and B (of equal size) of a graph G, does there
exist a sequence of independent sets of G that starts with A, ends with
B, such that every independent set in the sequence can be obtained from
the previous one by replacing one vertex? This problem is PSPACE-hard in
general. In this talk we will show that it can be solved in polynomial
time if G is a cograph, or more generally: if G can be obtained from a
set of simple base graphs by applying disjoint union and complete join
operations. These base graphs should be from a graph class for which the
problem itself can be solved efficiently, and for which a maximum
independent set can be computed efficiently. Chordal graphs are an
example of such a class.

This result is one of the first to demonstrate how dynamic programming
can be used to solve (PSPACE-hard) reconfiguration problems for
restricted graph classes. The talk will start with an overview of many
recent results on similar reconfiguration problems.
