Complexity Dichotomies for Counting Problems

We consider problems of computing quantities in the sum-product fashion, or
so-called "partition functions" from statistical physics. Such problems are
usually studied under certain framework, such as Counting H-colorings,
Counting Constraint Satisfaction Problems (#CSP), and Holant Problems.  A
dichotomy theorem states that within the framework, all problems are either
tractable or hard (usually #P-hard). In this talk we will cover some recent
development in classifying the complexity of #CSP and Holant problems.
