Variable Dependencies of Quantified Boolean Formulas

We study a concept of variable independence in Quantified Boolean Formulas
(QBFs). QBF solvers based on the QDPLL algorithm typically assign variables
strictly in the order induced by a formulaâ€™s quantifier prefix, rendering
heuristics for selecting decision variables ineffective. Recent extensions
of QDPLL try to tackle this problem by replacing the prefix order with the
relation given by a dependency scheme. We present and study a generalisation
of resolution for QBF that corresponds to the proof system used by such
solvers to generate proofs.
