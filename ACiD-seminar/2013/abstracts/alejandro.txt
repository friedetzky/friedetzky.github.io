A domino tatami covering is a classical domino tiling in which no 4 dominoes
meet.  This local restriction of the (polynomial time) question, “Can the
region R be covered with dominoes?” is NP-complete, and I give a reduction
from planar 3SAT, using a SAT-solver to construct the gadgets.  In the
second half of the talk I introduce monominoes, and I describe the tatami
structure.  I use this to enumerate certain coverings of the n x n square,
confirming something first observed to by Don Knuth.
