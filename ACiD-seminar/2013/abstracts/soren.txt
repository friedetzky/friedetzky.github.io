Dynamic communication networks and a new type of problems in Universal
Algebra

In the talk I present a number of distinct new ideas that in their pure
non-technical form should be quite easy to understand. The ideas can be
combined and elaborated in various ways.  I present a Theorem that resembles
the max-flow min-cut theorem, but which is technically quite different. Its
proof uses Menger Theorem (a variant of the max-flow min-cut theorem), and
draws on the techniques that Shannon used to prove his noisy-channel coding
theorem. The presentation will focus on the main ideas rather than on
technical elaborations.
