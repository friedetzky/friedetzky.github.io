Max Point-Tolerance Graphs 

A graph G is a max-point-tolerance (MPT) graph if each vertex v of G can be
mapped to a pointed-interval (I_v, p_v) where Iv is an interval of R and p_v
∈ I_v such that uv is an edge of G iﬀ I_u ∩ I_v ⊇ {p_u, p_v}. MPT graphs
model relationships among DNA fragments in genome-wide association studies
as well as basic transmission problems in telecommunications. We formally
introduce this graph class, characterize it, study combinatorial
optimization problems on it, and relate it to several well known graph
classes. We characterize MPT graphs as a special cases of several 2D
geometric intersection graphs; namely, triangle, rectangle, L-shape, and
line segment intersection graphs. We further characterize MPT as having
certain linear orders on their vertex set. Our last characterization is that
MPT graphs are precisely obtained by intersecting special pairs of interval
graphs. We also show that, on MPT graphs, the weighted independent set
problem can be solved in polynomial time, the colouring problem is
NP-complete, and the clique cover problem has a 2-approximation. Finally, we
demonstrate several connections to known graph classes; e.g., MPT graphs
strictly contain of interval graphs and outerplanar graphs, but are
incomparable to permutation, chordal, and planar graphs.
