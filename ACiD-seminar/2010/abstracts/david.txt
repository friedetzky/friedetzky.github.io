AN EFFECTIVE DICHOTOMY FOR THE COUNTING CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEM

Bulatov (2008) gave a dichotomy for the counting constraint satisfaction
problem #CSP.  A problem from #CSP is characterised by a constraint
language, a fixed, finite set of relations over a finite domain and
instances use these relations to constrain the values taken by
variables.  Bulatov showed that the problem of counting the satisfying
assignments of instances of any problem from #CSP is either in
polynomial time (FP) or is #P-complete, depending on the structure of
the constraint language.  Understanding his proof requires a secure
grasp of the universal algebra techniques he uses.

We give an elementary proof of the dichotomy, based on succinct
representations, which we call 'frames', of a class of highly structured
relations, which we call 'strongly rectangular'.  We show that these are
precisely the relations which are invariant under a Mal'tsev
polymorphism.  En route, we simplify a decision algorithm for strongly
rectangular constraint languages, due to Bulatov and Dalmau (2006).

We establish a new criterion for the #CSP dichotomy, which we call
'strong balance', and we prove that this property is decidable -- in
fact, in NP.  Thus, we show that the dichotomy is effective, resolving
the most important open question from Bulatov's work.

The talk will require no knowledge of universal algebra and should be
accessible to people without any detailed knowledge of the constraint
satisfaction problem.
