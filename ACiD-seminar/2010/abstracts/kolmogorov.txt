The complexity of conservative valued CSPs

In a valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP), a *language* is a
fixed set of cost functions over a fixed domain. An *instance* from this
language is specified by a sum of cost functions from the language, and
the goal is to minimise the sum. Classifying the complexity of such
minimisation problems for different languages has been an active
research area.

I will talk about our recent results on *conservative* languages, i.e.
languages containing all possible unary cost functions.  We prove that
if all functions in the language satisfy a certain condition then the
language is tractable, otherwise it is NP-hard.  This is the first
complete classification for general-valued constraint languages over
non-Boolean domains.
