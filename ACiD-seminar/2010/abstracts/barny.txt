A Random Walk through Infinite-domain CSP
Barnaby Martin

We survey the past, present and (insofar as temporally possible)
future of the area of infinite-domain constraint satisfaction
problems, mainly from the perspective of Bodirsky and his
collaborators. We are especially interested in matters of structure
and complexity as these manifest from a combinatorial,
universal-algebraic and/ or model-theoretic perspective.
