Computational Complexity of Traffic Hijacking under BGP and S-BGP

Harmful Internet hijacking incidents demonstrate how fragile the Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) is, which is used to exchange routing information
between Autonomous Systems (ASes). As shown recently, even S-BGP, the
secure variant of BGP that is being deployed, is not fully able to
prevent traffic attraction attacks. Given a traffic flow between two
ASes, we study how difficult it is for a malicious AS to devise a
strategy for hijacking or intercepting that flow. We show that this
problem exhibits a marked difference between BGP and S-BGP: Namely,
while it is solvable, under reasonable assumptions, in polynomial time
for the type of attacks that are usually performed in BGP, it is NP-hard
for S-BGP. We also solve a problem left open in the literature, stating
when performing a hijacking in S-BGP is equivalent to performing an
interception.
