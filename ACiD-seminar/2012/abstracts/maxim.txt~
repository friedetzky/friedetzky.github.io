New Approximation Algorithms for the Minimimum Set Cover and Other
Covering Problems
We study the relationship between the approximation factor for the SetCover problem and the parameters ∆ : the maximum cardinality of any
subset, and k : the maximum number of subsets containing any element
of the ground set. We show an LP rounding based approximation of (k −
ln ∆
1)(1 − e− k−1 ) + 1, which is substantially better than the classical algorithms
in the range k ≈ ln ∆, and also improves on related previous works [Krivelevich, Okun]. For the interesting case when k = θ(log ∆) we also exhibit an
integrality gap which essentially matches our approximation algorithm. In
addition we will discuss results on Generalized Min Sum Set Cover Problem.
I will describe the state of the art, our results and open problems.
