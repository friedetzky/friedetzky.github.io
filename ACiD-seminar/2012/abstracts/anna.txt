Skew Bisubmodularity and Valued CSPs

An instance of the Finite-Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP)
is given by a finite set of variables, a finite domain of values, and a
sum of rational-valued functions, each function depending on a subset of
the variables. The goal is to find an assignment of values to the
variables that minimises the sum.

In this talk I will investigate VCSPs in the case when the variables can
take three values and provide a tight description of the tractable
cases.

Joint work with Andrei Krokhin and Robert Powell.
