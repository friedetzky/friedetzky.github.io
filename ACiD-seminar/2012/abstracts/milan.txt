In this talk, I will consider the problem of distributed ranking of
alternatives in a network of nodes under limited memory per node and
limited information communicated between nodes. In particular, for the
case of ranking of two alternatives, each node in the network is assumed
to prefer one of the alternatives, and the goal for each node is to
correctly identify one of the two alternatives that is preferred by
majority of the nodes. This type of a problem has been studied under
various names such as consensus, k-selection and quantile computation.
The model is an abstraction that underlies various systems such as
ranking of items in distributed peer-to-peer systems, databases and may
also capture dynamics of opinion formation in social networks.
