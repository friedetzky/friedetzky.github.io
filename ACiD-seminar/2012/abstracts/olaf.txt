How difficult is it to verify proofs?

Traditionally proof complexity adopts the view that proofs are verified
in polynomial time and a rich body of +results is known for the
complexity of proofs in this framework. The talk will start by providing
an introduction to +main notions and motivations in proof complexity in
this classical setting. The second part of the talk is devoted to a
recent line of research trying to  understand the power of proof systems
that use alternative computational resources +to verify proofs.  In the
talk I will mention recent results where proofs are verified by either
additional +computational resources (such as advice, randomness, quantum
computations) or by very weak computational models. In particular, we
will look at a very weak model where proofs are verified by NC^0
circuits and show non-trivial lower and +upper bounds for this
restrictive model.
