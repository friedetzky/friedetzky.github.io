Parameterized Complexity and Ramsey Theory

Parameterized complexity is a recent branch of computational complexity
theory that provides a framework for a refined analysis of hard
algorithmic problems. Ramsey theory is a branch of mathematics that
studies the conditions under which order must appear. In this talk, we
will reveal various connections between the two fields.
