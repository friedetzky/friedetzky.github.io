A ramp scheme is a method of distributing shares in a secret among a set
of players in such a way that sufficiently small subsets of players
learn no information about the secret, whereas sufficiently large
subsets can recover it completely.  In this talk we discuss a
combinatorial treatment of recent results relating various parameters of
ramp schemes.  We explore connections between ramp schemes and error
correcting codes, and reinterpret these results in this context.
