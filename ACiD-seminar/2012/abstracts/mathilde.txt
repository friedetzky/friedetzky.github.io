Updating Automata Networks

An automata network is made of a set of entities (computational units seen
as black boxes) called automata, that can make each other change states.
The possible state changes of automata define the possible overall network
transitions. Two questions follow naturally: how does the structure of
interactions between automata, on the one hand, and the organisation of
local changes in time. On the other, impact on the global evolution
possibilities and the asymptotic behaviours of the network? I propose to
approach these questions with networks of Boolean automata in order to put
emphasis on (possibilities of) state changes rather than on the nature of
changes.
