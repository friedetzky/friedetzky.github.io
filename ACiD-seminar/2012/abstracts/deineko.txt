Specially structured matrices in combinatorial optimisation

Identifying polynomially solvable cases of NP-hard optimisation problems
is one of the well known branches in combinatorial optimisation. We
consider two classical problems such as the travelling salesman problem
and the quadratic assignment problem. It is known that if the underlying
distance matrices have special structures then the optimal solutions to
these problems can be found in polynomial time. We give a short survey
of known solvable cases as well as present some new relaxations on the
known structures in matrices which still keep these notoriously
difficult problems manageable.
