Dear XXX,

I organise the Computer Science theory group seminars at Durham
University.  We are in the process of scheduling the seminars for the
academic year 2012/13, and I would like to invite you to give a talk in
this seminar series.  

The seminars normally take place Thursdays at 5pm (different
arrangements may be made if necessary).  The talks should take no more
than 50 minutes, including a little time for questions.  The audience
comprises staff and graduate students of the CS theory group.  Generally
speaking, overview talks are fine, but some mathematical meat will be
appreciated as well.

If you are interested in coming then please direct your favourite web
browser to http://www.dur.ac.uk/tom.friedetzky/acidsem.html where you
can find an up-to-date schedule.  Seminar slots are normally given away
using a FCFS policy, and I expect the table to fill quickly.

We are happy to cover travel expenses (UK railway or equivalent).  We
will arrange for accommodation if required.

I look forward to hearing from you,
    Tom
