On the Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms - How Crossover Speeds Up 
Building-Block Assembly in Genetic Algorithms

Abstract:
Evolutionary algorithms are popular general-purpose algorithms for 
optimisation and design that use search operators like mutation, 
crossover and selection to "evolve" a population of good solutions. In
the past decades there has been a long and controversial debate about
when and why the crossover operator is useful. The building-block
hypothesis assumes that crossover is particularly helpful if it can
recombine good "building blocks", i. e. short parts of the genome that
lead to high fitness. However, all attempts at proving this rigorously
have been inconclusive. As of today, there is no rigorous and intuitive
explanation for the usefulness of crossover. In this talk we provide
such an explanation. For functions where "building blocks" need to be
assembled, we prove rigorously that many evolutionary algorithms with
crossover are twice as fast as the fastest evolutionary algorithm
using only mutation. The reason is that crossover effectively turns
fitness-neutral mutations into improvements by combining the right
building blocks at a later stage. This also leads to surprising
conclusions about the optimal mutation rate.
